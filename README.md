Just got out of 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Deva, and man, what a ride. I'm not even sure where my head's at right now or what my stomach is doing. Maybe it's digesting what I just saw, or that questionable popcorn I inhaled between scenes. 

First off, can we talk about that opening? Like, no warning at all. BAM! Scene hits you like a misplaced birt𝘏𝘋ay cake right in the face. Maybe that’s just Deva's charm. Or maybe they just ran out of time to build a smooth opening. Not gonna lie, I was a bit annoyed, considering I was still setting into my seat when the storyline drop kicked me.

Deva himself (herself? itself? I dunno) — what a character. Half the time I was trying to figure out if they were supposed to be an enigma or if the writers forgot to develop them beyond being just... there. But then again, maybe that's genius? Who am I to judge as I tap away on my tiny screen here with about as much impact on storytelling as a wet sock on a rainy road.

>The visuals? Oh, boy. Like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a unicorn explode on a canvas, yet not in a bad way. Vivid, chaotic, absolutely nothing makes sense, but you can't look away. It felt like if someone let a raccoon loose in a paint store and called it art. Ok, maybe that's a bit harsh. Ha, now I wanna 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just to pause and dissect each scene.

But then, just as I was starting to connect the dots, the subplot came crashing down like an overenthusiastic toddler with a handful of glitter. What’s their deal with never sticking to one plotline? It's like they took storytelling tips from a hyperactive dog chasing three different balls. The confusion tangles you up, and some folks walked out lost in their own thoughts. But isn't that also why we 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩  s? To be lost, then found again?

Here's the thing —or maybe it's just me— but there's something oddly comforting in that mess. Like, life's always twisting, turning, or maybe just stuck on a loop because it couldn't care less what I think.

```csharp
int getDevaLevelOfUnderstanding()
{
    return rand() % 10; // seems about right
}
```

I still can't decide if I liked it or if I'm just pretending to be profound. Overhearing folks discuss it while exiting, I guess there’s a weird solace knowing everyone else is just as confused. So, good job, Deva. You’ve ensured we're all in the same boat wrestling with our thoughts and questionable snack choices.

Was it worth the ticket price? Meh, possibly. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you’re ready to leave your brain at the door and get swept into the surreal wonderland with no promises of making it back with a map. But maybe pack an extra bag of patience. Just in case.
